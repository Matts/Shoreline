## 🌊 Why Shoreline?

Shoreline makes it effortless to expose internal services to the outside world — securely, locally, and on your terms. Whether you're triggering CI pipelines, receiving GitHub hooks, or syncing data — Shoreline acts as a trusted gateway to your private network.

No cloud tunnels. No port-forwarding hell. No vendor lock-in.  
**Just your infrastructure. Your rules.**
